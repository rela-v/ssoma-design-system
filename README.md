**More about ssoma-design-system and how it was developed**
The project ssoma-design-system began as a small project of 1 developer (myself). One of the major challenges associated with building AI-focused applications is developing trustworthy AI: and making UI which supports that mission. This codebase consists of a design system which is geared towards designers and developers in artificial intelligence, which will guide the development of UI for the new era of trustworthy AI by providing reusable components, patterns, and guidelines that pursue trustworthiness through both technical and societal trust-building.

**A Word of Thanks**
Thank you for your consideration towards this project. I would like to thank my dear and close friends who have supported me throughout my most formative years and encouraged me to pursue this project.
