# Ssoma Design System

**ssoma-design-system: "üß† üí¨ AI meets you."**

**What is ssoma-design-system?**
This repo, ssoma-design-system, is an open source project under the MIT license that has a vision of making AI a household product that expands every person‚Äôs efforts in word by helping us both convey and understand meanings, and in deed by helping us create tangible outcomes.

**More about ssoma-design-system and how it was developed**
The project ssoma-design-system began as a small project of 1 developer (myself). One of the major challenges associated with building AI-focused applications is developing trustworthy AI: and making UI which supports that mission. This codebase consists of a design system which is geared towards designers and developers in artificial intelligence, which will guide the development of UI for the new era of trustworthy AI by providing reusable components, patterns, and guidelines that pursue trustworthiness through both technical and societal trust-building.
